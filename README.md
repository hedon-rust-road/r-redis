# R-Redis üßÆ

R-Redis is a simplified version of Redis implemented in Rust. It supports basic Redis commands such as `SET`, `GET`, `HSET`, `HGET`, `HMGET`, `HGETALL`, `ECHO`, `SADD`, and `SISMEMBER`. This project allows you to interact with it using the official `redis-cli`.

## Features ‚ú®

- **SET**: Set the string value of a key.
- **GET**: Get the string value of a key.
- **HSET**: Set the string value of a field in a hash.
- **HGET**: Get the string value of a field in a hash.
- **HMGET**: Get the values of all the given fields in a hash.
- **HGETALL**: Get all the fields and values in a hash.
- **ECHO**: Echo the given string.
- **SADD**: Add one or more members to a set.
- **SISMEMBER**: Determine if a given value is a member of a set.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with r-redis, you need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hedon-rust-road/r-redis.git
cd r-redis
```

Build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Run the server:

```bash
./target/release/r-redis
```

## Usage üìö

Once the server is running, you can use the official `redis-cli` to interact with it:

```bash
redis-cli
```

You can now use the supported commands:

```bash
SET mykey "Hello, World!"
GET mykey
HSET myhash field1 "Hello"
HGET myhash field1
HMGET myhash field1 field2
HGETALL myhash
ECHO "Hello, World!"
SADD myset "Hello"
SISMEMBER myset "Hello"
```
